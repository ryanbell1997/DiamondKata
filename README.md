Diamond Code Kata for davidwhitney / CodeDojos -  https://github.com/davidwhitney/CodeDojos/tree/master/Diamond%20Kata

My implementation for this kata goes beyond just creating a diamond. I tried to write the code in a way in which you could easily add an implementation for another shape.

Time and memory complexity have been considered. For example, in the instance of a diamond, I chose to use a dictionary so that the space requirement is around half what it would be if you stored every line, as we are only iterating up and down the dictionary to get the shape we want. Thereâ€™s no need to store duplicate data. 

There are two branches with two different implementations. NumericalApproach follows a mathematical approach to calculate the number of spaces between the characters, however I initially thought that this is a less efficient method, because this approach is O(n) on the number of spaces.

The master approach copies the previous element and creates a substring of the spaces, and then adds the extra spaces for the next line. On research, I am under the impression that .SubString() is O(1), which means this section of the code scales better. What I will admit is this approach is not quite as clean and feels like it is more error prone.
